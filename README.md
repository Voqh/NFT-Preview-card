## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Flex-box has a flex container and flex items. The container is defined by the display property with the value of flex and all its direct children become flex items. Flex container and flex items have specific properties. Flex container properties;flex-direction, flex-wrap, flex-flow, justify-content, align-items and align-content. Properties for flex-items; order, flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis and align-self.
The axes. A flex-box has two axes; the main-axis and the cross-axis. A flex-container with the flex-direction property's value as row, its main axis is x-axis (horizontal), the cross-axis is the y-axis(horizontal) and a flex-container with the flex-direction property's value as column its main axis is the y-axis (vertical) the cross-axis is the x-axis (horizontal). Justy-content is the property used in aligning content along the main axis and the property align-items
used in aligning content along the cross axis.

```css
body{
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    /* background-color: var(--Very-dark-blue-B);
    font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
    font-size: 16px;
    color: var(--Soft-blue);
    height: 600px;
    line-height: 1.5; */

}

### Continued development
Study the CSS grid

### Useful resources
